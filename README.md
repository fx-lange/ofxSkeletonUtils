ofxSkeletonRecorder
================

ofxSkeletonRecorder is a small openFrameworks addon to save, load and modify skeleton data per frame and was created as a byproduct to my bachelor thesis. it is used to verify results of my own skeleton tracker - for example to prelabel a video input or to compare the calculated skeleton points with results from OpenNI.
